# SorbonnePlottingTool

IMPORTANT !
If a figure appears and instantly disappears, just plot it one more time. Unfortunetly, we were not able to fix this error. It will disappear every second time, but it should not change the plotting result. Just click the button second time.


How to use this tool :
1.) Launch .exe file or main.py. 
2.) Choose dimension of the figure that you want to plot.
3.) Choose what type of figure do you want : 
  a.) rectangle - Write in the blank spaces coordinate x and y of center of the rectangle. In the following blank spaces write length and height of rectangle. To obtain square set length = height
  b.) ellipse - Write in the blank spaces coordinate x and y of center of the ellipse. In the following blank spaces write parameters a and b of ellipse equation. (x^2/a^b)+(y^2/b^2) = 1. To obtain circle set a = b.
  c.) custom - write list of points that you want to plot. They have to be written in the following formula : [x1, y1],[x2,y2], ... ,[xn,yn].Number of spaces doesn't matter. Keep in mind that points connect in the given order, so you shouldn't input random points. Instead try to draw a figure of of points without "lifting pen". 
4.) After clicking button "next" the figure should be already plotted. To draw same figure with other size close the current plot and then click the "next" button twice.
